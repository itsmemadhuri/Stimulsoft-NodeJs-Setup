# Stimulsoft-NodeJs-Setup
This is the setup project for demonstarting inclusion of Stimulsoft Designer/Viewer in NodeJs environment


Bottomline in here is that we need to include an adapter (javascript adapter) that are specific to database vendors to 
connect Stimulsoft JS to database.
For the analogy.. these adapters are the JDBC of StimulsoftJS.

In here ,MSSQL adapter is considered.
